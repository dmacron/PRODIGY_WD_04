Weather App with Real-Time API Integration 
I developed a weather app that retrieves real-time weather data using the WeatherAPI. The app allows users to search for any location and view live weather information, including temperature, weather conditions, time, and day. The app features a responsive design and dynamic display, ensuring a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, WeatherAPI
Features:
Search by location
Displays current weather, temperature, time, and condition
Responsive design for mobile and desktop
Live updates from WeatherAPI
This project helped me improve my skills in API integration and frontend development!
